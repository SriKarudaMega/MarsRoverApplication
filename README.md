# MarsRoverApplication
The Mars Rover Application is a simulation program that models the operations of a Mars rover navigating a grid-based terrain. The application allows users to define a grid, place obstacles, and control a rover using simple commands. The goal is to demonstrate the roverâ€™s movement capabilities and its ability to handle obstacles on a grid.
